modules vs templates vs layouts

modules
Create all your components here which are more than a basic building block. 
This could be a header or a footer component. Most likely those modules are 
built out of multiple elements.

templates
In the templates directory, you should place all your page templates which 
are then called from your Next.js specific pages. 

layouts
Layouts are used to wrap your Templates and provide them with the components 
which will be displayed by default in a specific layout. For example, you 
would include the Footer and the Header in a default layout.
